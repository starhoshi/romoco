## Non-leaked promo codes

romoco is hosted on GitHub Pages, because promo codes should not be leaked.
GitHub Pages has a weak analysis function, so I cannot recognize the promo codes.

If you are unsure, please self-host your code in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/starhoshi/romoco/tree/gh-pages).

## Development

romoco uses the Static Site Generation feature of Nextjs.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### export

Static files are generated in the `out` directory.

```bash
$ npm run build
```
